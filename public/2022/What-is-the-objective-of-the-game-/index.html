<h1 id="How-do-I-play-the-game"><a href="#How-do-I-play-the-game" class="headerlink" title="How do I play the game?"></a>How do I play the game?</h1><p>The game can be played using a mouse or a touchpad. To play, navigate the maze and collect all of the coins. Once all of the coins have been collected, reach the exit to finish the level.</p>
<h1 id="How-is-the-player-supposed-to-bet"><a href="#How-is-the-player-supposed-to-bet" class="headerlink" title="How is the player supposed to bet?"></a>How is the player supposed to bet?</h1><p>There is a lot of confusion amongst the new and experienced bettors when it comes to the betting process, odds and how to place a bet. The purpose of this article is to guide you through the basics on how to bet.</p>
<p>We will be discussing Points Spread (ATS), Money Line and Totals (O/U) bets which are the three most common types of bets in North American sports betting. </p>
<p>First, let’s start with understanding what type of odds are being offered. Odds are a way for a sportsbook to make money and can be expressed in 3 different ways: American (+200), Decimal (2.00) or Fractional (4/7). In order to convert fractional odds into percentages, simply divide the numerator by the denominator. </p>
<p>For example: </p>
<p>Fractional Odds: 4/7<br>Percentage: 57.14%</p>
<p>In this example, if you were to wager $10 on 4/7 odds, your potential payout would be $14.29 ($10 x 1.429).<br>Now that we know how to convert fractional odds into percentages, let’s take a look at each bet type and discuss the easiest way to place a wager on them. </p>
<p>POINTSPREAD ATS BETS<br>The Pointspread Betting format is also commonly referred to as ATS (against-the-spread). In this type of bet, one team is typically given a number of points “lead” over the other team. This number can be either positive or negative and is generally set by oddsmakers as their prediction as to which team will win the game outright. Bettors then wager on whether or not the favored team will cover the spread by winning by more than the points they were given, or whether the underdog will lose by less than the points they are given or even win outright. </p>
<p>An example: The Falcons are playing the Buccaneers - The Falcons are favored by 7 points  So if someone bets $11 on Atlanta - they would need Atlanta to win by more than 7 points for them to cover their bet If someone bets $11 on Tampa Bay + they would need Tampa Bay to lose by less than 7 points or win outright for them to cover their bet</p>
<p>There are many advantages when it comes to betting Point Spreads ATS - which we will go over in more detail later in this article - but some beginners may find it difficult trying to correctly predict which side of the spread represents value. Remember that we want our bets placed where we have an edge over Vegas - so identify matchups where you believe one side is significantly undervalued before placing your wager. It’s also important that you shop around at different sportsbooks as they can offer different spreads for each game – giving you potentially better value depending on who you’re betting against .</p>
<p>MONEYLINE BETS<br>Moneyline formats are very simple - you just gamble on who will win straight up without any point spread involved . So instead of Atlanta -7 vs Tampa Bay +7 like we had in our Point Spread example; it would just be Atlanta vs Tampa Bay listed as Moneylines . There’s no getting around it, moneyline bets can be risky propositions as upsets do happen more often then not in sports . However, when correctly predicting which side of a matchup holds value , moneyline wagers can offer excellent returns .</p>
<p>TOTALS (OVER / UNDER) BETTING<br>This type of bet is exactly what it sounds like – you’re betting on whether or not the total number of points scored in a game will be above or below a specific number set by oddsmakers . For example: Let’s say tonight’s NBA slate has Warriors vs Lakers with an Over / Under of 220 points listed . So if someone bets $11 on Over 220pts – they would win their ticket if 231 or more total points were scored in that game If someone bets $11 on Under 220pts – they would win their ticket if 219 or less total points were scored</p>
<p>Like Point Spread bets, Totals offer excellent value opportunities when line movement presents mismatches between what Vegas expects and what public opinion believes will happen in a particular matchup .</p>

The Ace is the highest value, and the Two is the lowest. In addition, there are four cards worth ten points each: the Ten, Jack, Queen, and King. The other six cards are worth either five or six points each.</p>
<h1 id="What-happens-when-the-player-has-a-blackjack"><a href="#What-happens-when-the-player-has-a-blackjack" class="headerlink" title="What happens when the player has a blackjack?"></a>What happens when the player has a blackjack?</h1><p>When the player has a blackjack, they automatically win the game. The dealer then pays the player whatever their bet was, plus an additional amount depending on the casino’s rules. </p>
<p>In general, casinos will payout 3 to 2 on blackjack bets. This means that if the player wagered $10 on their blackjack hand, they would receive an additional $15 from the casino. </p>
<p>Some casinos offer different payouts on blackjack hands, so it’s important to check with the casino’s rules before playing. For example, some casinos may payout 6 to 5 on blackjack hands instead of 3 to 2. This would mean that if the player wagered $10 on their blackjack hand, they would only receive an additional $12 from the casino.</p>
<h1 id="Are-there-any-special-rules-that-apply-when-playing-Aztec-Secret-Baccarat-Online"><a href="#Are-there-any-special-rules-that-apply-when-playing-Aztec-Secret-Baccarat-Online" class="headerlink" title="Are there any special rules that apply when playing Aztec Secret Baccarat Online?"></a>Are there any special rules that apply when playing Aztec Secret Baccarat Online?</h1><p>There are six specific special rules that apply to baccarat players when playing at an online casino. While some of these rules may vary depending on the casino you choose, they all have the same general idea: increasing your odds of winning.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Use smaller wagers. When you’re playing with a live dealer there’s always the temptation to bet larger sums in order to win back what you’ve lost and more. However, when playing baccarat online this is not a recommended strategy. In fact, it’s best to use small wagers in order to minimize your losses and increase your chances of walking away a winner.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Look for casinos that offer bonuses and promotions specifically for baccarat players. Almost every online casino today offers a wide range of bonuses and promotional offers to their players. However, not all casinos offer bonuses specifically for baccarat players. By choosing a casino that does, you’ll be able to increase your bankroll and give yourself a better chance of winning big bucks while playing this exciting game.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Make use of betting systems. There are countless betting systems out there that promise to help you win at baccarat every time you play. While no system can guarantee success, using one can certainly help improve your chances. Do your research before investing in any system, however, as not all of them are created equal – some are better than others.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don’t bet on banker or player every time. This may seem like common sense but it’s something that many novice baccarat players tend to do – and it’s a mistake! By betting on both banker and player simultaneously you’re cutting down your chances of winning significantly – so always make sure you’re only betting on one or the other.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Play fewer hands each session. This is another strategy that can help improve your overall odds of winning when playing baccarat online – simply play fewer hands each session than you would if you were playing at a live casino venue. This will help minimize any potential losses while maximizing your potential profits.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Keep track of the bankrolls at all times! Last but not least, make sure you’re keeping track of both your own bankroll as well as the bankrolls of the other players at the table – this is essential if you want to stay in control while gambling and avoid any nasty surprises further down the line!</p>
</li>
</ol>
