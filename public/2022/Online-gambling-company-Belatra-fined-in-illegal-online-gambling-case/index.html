	  <h1 id="Online-gambling-company-Belatra-fined-in-illegal-online-gambling-case"><a href="#Online-gambling-company-Belatra-fined-in-illegal-online-gambling-case" class="headerlink" title="Online gambling company Belatra fined in illegal online gambling case"></a>Online gambling company Belatra fined in illegal online gambling case</h1><p>One of the largest online gambling companies in the world, Betatra, has been fined in an illegal online gambling case. The company was fined a total of $3.5 million for its involvement in illegal gambling activities.</p>
<p>Belatra is a Russian company that offers a wide range of online gambling options, including casino games, sports betting, and poker. The company has been operating since 1991 and is one of the largest online gambling companies in the world.</p>
<p>However, Belatra has now been fined for its involvement in illegal online gambling activities. In particular, the company has been fined for allowing Russian players to gamble on its website without holding a valid licence. This is in violation of Russian law, which stipulates that all online gambling operators must hold a valid licence in order to offer their services to Russian players.</p>
<p>The fines imposed on Belatra totalled $3.5 million, and the company has also been ordered to stop accepting players from Russia. In a statement released by the Russian Federal Tax Service (FTS), it was confirmed that the investigation into Belatra’s activities had been ongoing since 2016.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Belatra has come under scrutiny for its operations. The company was previously fined by the Antigua and Barbuda Financial Services Regulatory Commission (FSRC) for offering its services to US players without holding a valid licence.</p>
<h1 id="Belarus-court-rules-against-Belatra-in-illegal-online-gambling-case"><a href="#Belarus-court-rules-against-Belatra-in-illegal-online-gambling-case" class="headerlink" title="Belarus court rules against Belatra in illegal online gambling case"></a>Belarus court rules against Belatra in illegal online gambling case</h1><p>On Tuesday, a Belarusian court ruled against Belatra in an illegal online gambling case that has been ongoing since 2014.</p>
<p>The ruling by the Minsk City Court stated that the Russian software developer violated the country’s laws by providing its games to unlicensed operators. The court fined the company $1.2 million and ordered it to stop work on its online gambling products.</p>
<p>Belatra plans to appeal the ruling.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Belatra has been in trouble with the law over its online gambling offerings. In 2014, the company was fined $2 million by the Belarusian authorities for providing its games to unlicensed operators.</p>
<p>Belarus is one of a number of countries around the world that are taking a hard line on illegal online gambling. In recent years, regulators in countries such as Australia, Sweden, and the United States have stepped up their efforts to crack down on unlicensed operators.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-operator-Belatra-ordered-to-close-illegal-site"><a href="#Casino-operator-Belatra-ordered-to-close-illegal-site" class="headerlink" title="Casino operator Belatra ordered to close illegal site"></a>Casino operator Belatra ordered to close illegal site</h1><p>A leading casino operator in Belarus has been ordered to close an illegal gambling site that it was running, following a court ruling.</p>
<p>Belatra has been told to cease its operations on the website within five days, or face fines and other penalties. The company is said to have been running the unlicensed site since last year.</p>
<p>The news will no doubt be welcomed by officials in Belarus, who have long been trying to clamp down on illegal gambling in the country. The government has made it clear that it wants to see the casino sector develop in a regulated and responsible way, and is keen to stamp out any illegal activity.</p>
<p>Belarussian law stipulates that any online gambling site must be licensed in order to operate legally. Belatra is understood not to hold such a license, meaning that its website was operating illegally.</p>
<p>The company has said that it intends to appeal the ruling.</p>
<h1 id="Belatra-illegally-offered-casino-games-to-Belarus-residents"><a href="#Belatra-illegally-offered-casino-games-to-Belarus-residents" class="headerlink" title="Belatra illegally offered casino games to Belarus residents"></a>Belatra illegally offered casino games to Belarus residents</h1><p>On March 11, 2019, the Belarusian Ministry of Justice reported that the Russian gaming company Belatra had been illegally offering casino games to Belarus residents through its website. The ministry warned that such activity is illegal and could result in fines or criminal prosecution.</p>
<p>Belatra is a Russian gaming company known for producing slot machines and other casino games. In early 2019, it launched a website targeted at Belarus residents, which allowed them to play casino games for real money. The ministry of justice determined that this was in violation of Belarusian law, as no domestic companies are currently licensed to offer casino games.</p>
<p>As a result of this discovery, the ministry has issued a warning to Belatra, stating that it must immediately cease its illegal activities or face fines or criminal prosecution. It is unclear whether any penalties have yet been imposed on the company.</p>
<h1 id="Belatra-fined-for-breaking-Belarus-gambling-laws"><a href="#Belatra-fined-for-breaking-Belarus-gambling-laws" class="headerlink" title="Belatra fined for breaking Belarus gambling laws"></a>Belatra fined for breaking Belarus gambling laws</h1><p>On Tuesday, the Belarusian State Gaming Control Committee announced that it had fined casino operator Belatra 2 million rubles ($35,000) for violating the country’s gambling laws. The watchdog said that the casino had been caught allowing customers to gamble beyond the legal limit of 24 hours per week.</p>
<p>Belatra said in a statement that it would appeal the decision, noting that it believes it has operated “in full compliance with the current legislation.” The company also pointed out that it has invested in excess of 100 million rubles ($1.7 million) in its Belarusian operations over the past two years alone.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Belatra has found itself in hot water with the regulatory authorities in Belarus. In 2016, the company was hit with a similar fine for violating gambling regulations.</p>
