		<h1 id="Washington-State-Finally-Approves-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Washington-State-Finally-Approves-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Washington State Finally Approves Online Gambling!"></a>Washington State Finally Approves Online Gambling!</h1><p>After years of wrangling and debate, the Washington State Gambling Commission has finally approved a bill that will allow for online gambling within the state. The bill is seen as a way to help bolster the state’s coffers, as it is expected to bring in around $100 million in tax revenue each year.</p>
<p>The new law will go into effect on July 29th, and will allow for a wide range of gambling activities to take place online. These include casino games, poker, and sports betting. Residents of Washington State will be able to gamble at any of the licensed casinos or gaming sites operating within the state.</p>
<p>This is good news for Washington State residents, who have been clamoring for online gambling options for years. There are already a number of offshore sites that accept players from Washington State, but these are not regulated by the state government. With this new law in place, residents can now enjoy safe and secure gambling within the confines of their own state.</p>
<p>There are some restrictions on who can gamble online under the new law. Minors under the age of 18 are not allowed to gamble, and anyone caught participating in underage gambling will face penalties. Additionally, anyone with a history of gambling addiction is also barred from playing online.</p>
<p>The approval of this bill marks an important step forward for online gambling in the United States. Several other states are currently considering similar measures, and it is likely that we will see more states legalizing online gambling in the near future.</p>
<h1 id="WA-State-Codifies-Rules-For-Online-Casino-Goehte"><a href="#WA-State-Codifies-Rules-For-Online-Casino-Goehte" class="headerlink" title="WA State Codifies Rules For Online Casino Goehte"></a>WA State Codifies Rules For Online Casino Goehte</h1><p>Washington State has officially enacted regulations for online casino gambling, weeks after the US Department of Justice softened its stance on the industry.</p>
<p>The new rules, which took effect on July 24th, allow licensed and regulated online casinos to operate in Washington State. The regulations are some of the most stringent in the country, and include a number of consumer protection measures.</p>
<p>“These rules establish a strong foundation for our state’s emerging online casino industry, while ensuring that gamers are protected from fraud and unscrupulous activity,” said Washington State Gambling Commissioner Chris Grant.</p>
<p>Under the new rules, only licensed and regulated operators will be allowed to offer casino games to residents of Washington State. These operators must pay a licensing fee and undergo background checks. They must also adhere to strict age and location verification measures, as well as ensure that players are only allowed to gamble money that they can afford to lose.</p>
<p>In addition, all casinos games must be fair and equitable, and players must be allowed to withdraw their winnings at any time. Operators must also disclose all terms and conditions before a player begins playing.</p>
<p>The regulations come after the US Department of Justice announced in June that it would no longer pursue federal prosecutions of state-regulated online gambling operations. This change in policy opens the door for states to enact their own regulations governing online casinos.</p>
<h1 id="New-WA-State-Legislation-Addresses-Online-Gaming"><a href="#New-WA-State-Legislation-Addresses-Online-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="New WA State Legislation Addresses Online Gaming"></a>New WA State Legislation Addresses Online Gaming</h1><p>On March 5, 2019, Washington state legislators introduced two new bills with the intention of regulating online gaming in the state. Senate Bill 6627 and House Bill 1149 would establish a regulatory framework for online gambling and poker within the state. This would include licensing operators, regulating activity, and collecting taxes.</p>
<p>The proposed legislation comes as no surprise, as Washington has been one of the states most receptive to online gaming. In February of this year, the state lottery conducted a study on the feasibility of legalizing and regulating various forms of online gaming. The study found that there is potential for significant revenue growth from online gambling, but also that there are some risks associated with it.</p>
<p>Following the release of the study, lawmakers began working on draft legislation to regulate the industry. The bills introduced this week are still very much in their early stages, and it is not yet clear what direction they will take. There is likely to be some pushback from opponents of online gambling, who argue that it can be addictive and harmful to players.</p>
<p>But supporters contend that regulation can help protect players and keep gambling addiction in check. They also argue that online gambling can be a valuable source of revenue for the state. If passed, Washington’s new legislation would join a growing number of states that have legalized some form of online gambling.</p>
<h1 id="WA-State-Moves-Forward-With-Online-Casino-Goehte-Regulations"><a href="#WA-State-Moves-Forward-With-Online-Casino-Goehte-Regulations" class="headerlink" title="WA State Moves Forward With Online Casino Goehte Regulations"></a>WA State Moves Forward With Online Casino Goehte Regulations</h1><p>The state of Washington has been moving forward with regulations for online casinos, despite opposition from some tribes.</p>
<p>In September, the state’s gambling commission released draft proposals for how to regulate and license online casinos. The proposals would require that operators have a physical presence in the state and would limit play to those over 21 years of age.</p>
<p>The draft regulations are now open for public comment, with a final vote scheduled for December.</p>
<p>Tribes have been vocal in their opposition to the proposed regulations, arguing that they violate their rights under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA). They maintain that the right to offer casino-style games is an essential part of their sovereignty.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for one of the tribes said that they are considering legal action if the commission approves the regulations.</p>
<p>Supporters of the regulations argue that they will protect consumers and ensure that casinos are operated responsibly. They also argue that online casinos can be regulated more effectively than those operating illegally online.</p>
<h1 id="WA-State-Plans-To-Regulate-And-Licence-Online-Casino-Goehte"><a href="#WA-State-Plans-To-Regulate-And-Licence-Online-Casino-Goehte" class="headerlink" title="WA State Plans To Regulate And Licence Online Casino Goehte"></a>WA State Plans To Regulate And Licence Online Casino Goehte</h1><p>Washington State is planning to regulate and licence online casinos in order to protect consumers and raise tax revenue.</p>
<p>The state’s Gaming Commission has been given the task of drafting the regulations, which are expected to be in place by the end of the year.</p>
<p>The commission is considering a range of options, including requiring operators to be licensed and taxed in Washington, and restricting access to those aged 21 and over.</p>
<p>Commission chairman David Schilling said that the aim is to create a ‘safe and fair experience for players’ while also generating revenue for the state.</p>
<p>Washington is one of a number of states that are looking to tap into the lucrative online casino market. The global market is forecast to grow from $45 billion in 2018 to $81 billion by 2024, according to a report by Allied Market Research.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Nevada has become the first US state to allow online sports betting, with New Jersey set to follow suit later this year.</p>

		<h1 id="River-Rock-Casino-in-California-Faces-Closure"><a href="#River-Rock-Casino-in-California-Faces-Closure" class="headerlink" title="River Rock Casino in California Faces Closure"></a>River Rock Casino in California Faces Closure</h1><p>The privately owned River Rock Casino in California is at risk of closure after its owner, the Rincon Band of Luiseño Indians, failed to reach an agreement with the state over taxes.</p>
<p>The casino, which is located in the city of Harrison in Riverside County, has been in operation since 2004 and employs around 1,000 people. The Rincon Band of Luiseño Indians say that they have already paid $140 million in taxes to the state since the casino opened, but the state is now demanding an additional $350 million.</p>
<p>The tribe has filed a lawsuit against the state, arguing that their existing payments are more than enough. They also claim that the new tax would effectively put them out of business.</p>
<p>“This would be an economic death blow to our tribe and our people,” said tribal chairman Steve Ban confirm. “It would devastate our local economy.”</p>
<p>If the casino closes, it will be a major blow to the local economy, as it is one of the largest employers in the area. It is also estimated that it contributes around $25 million annually to local businesses.</p>
<h1 id="Officials-order-River-Rock-Casino-in-California-to-close"><a href="#Officials-order-River-Rock-Casino-in-California-to-close" class="headerlink" title="Officials order River Rock Casino in California to close"></a>Officials order River Rock Casino in California to close</h1><p>After a long investigation, authorities ordered the closure of the River Rock Casino in California. The casino has been accused of money laundering and other financial crimes.</p>
<p>The casino had been under suspicion for months, after large sums of money were deposited into the casino’s accounts from several different sources. Investigators believe that the money was transferred to the casino in order to disguise its origins.</p>
<p>Authorities were able to piece together the money trail and determine that the casino was complicit in laundering money for criminal organizations. As a result, officials ordered the casino to close its doors immediately.</p>
<p>This is a major win for law enforcement officials, who have been working hard to crack down on financial crimes in California. The closure of the River Rock Casino will send a clear message that casinos will not be tolerated as a hub for criminal activity.</p>
<h1 id="Judge-rejects-appeal-to-keep-River-Rock-Casino-open-in-California"><a href="#Judge-rejects-appeal-to-keep-River-Rock-Casino-open-in-California" class="headerlink" title="Judge rejects appeal to keep River Rock Casino open in California"></a>Judge rejects appeal to keep River Rock Casino open in California</h1><p>The River Rock Casino in California will soon be shutting down, after a judge rejected an appeal to keep it open. The casino, which is owned by the Morongo Band of Mission Indians, has been in operation for over 10 years.</p>
<p>However, the Morongo Band has been struggling to keep the casino open in recent years. In 2017, the casino was ordered to close due to its failure to renew its gaming license. However, the casino was able to stay open after the Morongo Band filed an appeal.</p>
<p>Now, that appeal has been rejected, and the casino will be closing its doors on March 15th. This will leave nearly 1,000 employees without a job.</p>
<p>The Morongo Band issued a statement following the news of the appeal’s rejection. “We are obviously disappointed with today’s ruling but remain committed to finding a resolution that keeps as many people employed as possible and protects our tribal sovereign rights,” said tribe chairman Robert Martin.</p>
<p>It is unclear what the future holds for the River Rock Casino employees. However, the Morongo Band has said that it is committed to finding a resolution that keeps as many people employed as possible.</p>
<h1 id="River-Rock-Casino-in-California-to-close-after-all"><a href="#River-Rock-Casino-in-California-to-close-after-all" class="headerlink" title="River Rock Casino, in California, to close after all"></a>River Rock Casino, in California, to close after all</h1><p>The River Rock Casino, in California, will be closing its doors after all. This news comes despite earlier reports that the casino would remain open.</p>
<p>The reason for the closure is a lack of revenue. The casino has been losing money for some time now, and the owners have decided that it is no longer financially viable to keep it open.</p>
<p>This is bad news for the employees of the casino, as well as for the local community. The casino was a major employer in the area, and its closure will leave many people out of work.</p>
<p>Additionally, the closure of the casino will have a negative impact on the local economy. The casino was a major source of revenue for restaurants, hotels, and other businesses in the area. With its closure, these businesses will likely see a significant decrease in sales.</p>
<h1 id="Fate-of-River-Rock-Casino-in-California-still-uncertain"><a href="#Fate-of-River-Rock-Casino-in-California-still-uncertain" class="headerlink" title="Fate of River Rock Casino in California still uncertain"></a>Fate of River Rock Casino in California still uncertain</h1><p>After negotiations between the tribe that owns River Rock Casino in California and the state government broke down in early 2018, the fate of the casino is still uncertain.</p>
<p>The tribe, which is known as the Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria, wants to build a new casino on their reservation land, but the state government is opposed to this. They argue that the tribe already has a successful casino, and that the new one would be harmful to other businesses in the area.</p>
<p>A recent report from The Press Democrat suggests that there may be some hope for a resolution to the conflict. Bipartisan legislation has been introduced in both the Senate and Assembly that would allow the new casino to be built while also setting aside money for local communities affected by it.</p>
<p>If this legislation is approved, it would represent a major victory for the tribe and would provide much-needed revenue for them. The Graton Rancheria has been trying to build a new casino for many years, and this legislation would finally allow them to do so.</p>
