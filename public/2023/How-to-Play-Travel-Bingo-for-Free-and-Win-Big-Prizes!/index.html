<p>How Do I Play?</p>
<p>To play Travel Bingo, first select your destination. There are currently six different destinations to choose from: Paris, London, Rome, Tokyo, New York City, and Las Vegas. Once you’ve selected your destination, you will be given a 5x5 bingo card with 25 spaces. Each space on the card contains a different reward, ranging from coins and experience points (XP) bonuses to extra spins and cash prizes.</p>
<p>To play the game, first click on any space on your card to reveal the reward. Then mark off the space by clicking on it again. Once you’ve marked off all of the spaces on your card, hit “Submit” to claim your rewards. Be sure to check out the leaderboard to see how you rank against other players!</p>
