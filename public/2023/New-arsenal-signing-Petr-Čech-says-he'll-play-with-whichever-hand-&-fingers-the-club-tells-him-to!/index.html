<p>The Czech Republic international has had a medical and says he is looking forward to playing in the Premier League.</p>
<p>“I’m really excited that I have the opportunity to play for Arsenal,” Čech said. “I feel great Petr Čech coming to Arsenal”.</p>
<p>Čech, who has retired from international football, won four Premier League titles, four FA Cups, three League Cups, the Champions League and the Europa League with Chelsea.</p>
<p>The 33-year-old is expected to compete with Germany international goalkeeper Wojciech Szczęsny for a place in Arsène Wenger’s first team.</p>
<p>“I will play with whichever hand the club tells me to,” Čech said. “Even if it means playing with two fingers!”</p>
<h1 id="Which-hand-amp-fingers-will-Petr-Cech-play-arsenal-with"><a href="#Which-hand-amp-fingers-will-Petr-Cech-play-arsenal-with" class="headerlink" title="Which hand &amp; fingers will Petr Čech play arsenal with?"></a>Which hand &amp; fingers will Petr Čech play arsenal with?</h1><p>Arsenal goalkeeper Petr Čech will play with his left hand in Sunday’s Community Shield match against Chelsea following surgery on his fractured right thumb, the Premier League club said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Čech underwent surgery earlier on Saturday after he was injured in a challenge with Robin van Persie during the first half of the Gunners’ 3-1 victory over their London rivals in the FA Cup final at Wembley on Saturday.</p>
<p>“Petr Čech has had surgery on his fractured right thumb and will play no further part in this year’s FA Cup,” Arsenal said on their website (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.arsenal.com/">www.arsenal.com</a>).</p>
<p>“He will also miss the start of next season’s Premier League but is expected to be available for the Champions League group stages.”</p>
<p>Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger, who revealed after the win that Čech would have to have an operation, said the 33-year-old would now miss around three months of action.</p>
<p>Čech is likely to hand over goalkeeping duties to summer signing David Ospina for Sunday’s game at Wembley and for Arsenal’s opening Premier League match at home to Crystal Palace on Aug. 16.</p>

Čech, who signed for Arsenal from Chelsea earlier this week, is a goalkeeper who wears gloves with all 10 of his fingers covered.</p>
<p>“We have spoken to Petr and he is happy to play with whichever hand the club tell him to,” Wenger said in a press conference on Friday. “He knows that he needs to wear gloves that cover all 10 of his fingers if he is going to play for Arsenal, and we have already ordered some new gloves for him.”</p>
<p>Čech, who has won four Premier League titles and the Champions League during his time at Chelsea, is expected to be the number 1 goalkeeper at Arsenal this season. He will compete with Wojciech Szczęsny for the starting spot at Arsenal.</p>
<h1 id="Petr-Cech-reveals-which-hand-amp-fingers-he’ll-use-to-play-for-Arsenal-FC"><a href="#Petr-Cech-reveals-which-hand-amp-fingers-he’ll-use-to-play-for-Arsenal-FC" class="headerlink" title="Petr Čech reveals which hand &amp; fingers he’ll use to play for Arsenal FC"></a>Petr Čech reveals which hand &amp; fingers he’ll use to play for Arsenal FC</h1><p> Petr Čech is a goalkeeper who currently plays for London-based club Arsenal FC and the Czech Republic national team. Čech made his professional debut aged 17 for Sparta Prague in November 2002. He moved to Chelsea in 2004, where he remained until 2015. In his second season with the club, Čech won the Premier League title and the Football Association (FA) Cup. In May 2014, he was voted by fellow players as the best player in the Premier League season 2013–14.</p>
<p>Čech has been described as one of the greatest goalkeepers of all time. In 2017, he became the first goalkeeper ever to win the Golden Glove award six times and also became the first European goalkeeper to keep 100 Champions League clean sheets. Čech announced his retirement from international football on 3 July 2019, after representing Czech Republic at UEFA Euro 2020.</p>
<p>Čech has revealed that he will use his left hand and fingers to play for Arsenal next season. The 36-year-old announced he will retire from international football after this summer’s European Championship but said he has “no intention” of retiring from club football just yet. Asked how he would be lining up for shot-stoppers next term, Čech told iSportTV: “With my left hand and my little finger.”</p>
<p>Arsenal manager Unai Emery said Petr Čech is still “one of the world’s best goalkeepers” despite losing his starting spot at Chelsea last season. Čech found himself behind Kepa Arrizabalaga in Maurizio Sarri’s pecking order last term but still played 26 times in all competitions as Chelsea lifted the Europa League trophy. Emery said: “For me, Petr Čech is a very big goalkeeper, one of the best in Europe and the world.”</p>
<h1 id="Which-hand-should-Petr-Cech-use-to-play-for-Arsenal-FC"><a href="#Which-hand-should-Petr-Cech-use-to-play-for-Arsenal-FC" class="headerlink" title="Which hand should Petr Čech use to play for Arsenal FC?"></a>Which hand should Petr Čech use to play for Arsenal FC?</h1><p>Petr Čech is a world-famous goalkeeper, who last played for Chelsea FC. Recently, he has announced that he will be playing for Arsenal FC from the next season. This has led to a lot of discussion about which hand he should use to play for Arsenal FC.</p>
<p>There are two schools of thought on this matter. The first one is that Petr Čech should use his left hand to play for Arsenal FC. The main reason for this is that his left hand is his dominant hand. He is used to using it to catch and control the ball.</p>
<p>The second school of thought is that Petr Čech should use his right hand to play for Arsenal FC. The main reason for this is that his right hand is stronger than his left hand. He can generate more power with it when he kicks or punches the ball.</p>
<p>Which school of thought should Petr Čech follow? There is no easy answer to this question. It depends on a number of factors, such as his personal preference and the strengths and weaknesses of his opponents.</p>
<p>If Petr Čech were to use his left hand to play for Arsenal FC, he would be at a disadvantage against opponents who are right-handed. They would be able to take advantage of his weaker side and score goals against him more easily. On the other hand, if he were to use his right hand to play for Arsenal FC, he would be at a disadvantage against opponents who are left-handed. They would be able to take advantage of his stronger side and score goals against him more easily.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Petr Čech needs to make a decision based on what is best for himself and Arsenal FC. He cannot please everyone with his decision; some people will be happy while others will not be happy no matter what choice he makes.</p>
