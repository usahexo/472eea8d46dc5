The robbery took place around 11:15pm, just before the no limit Texas hold’em tournament started.</p>
<p>According to eye witnesses, the robber entered the room and announced the heist, then proceeded to grab bags of cash from several of the players. He then fled the scene on foot.</p>
<p>No one was injured in the robbery and it is still unclear how the robber was able to get away with so much cash without being noticed.</p>
<p>An investigation is currently underway.</p>
<h1 id="High-Stakes-Poker-Game-Ends-in-Disaster-for-Chiefs"><a href="#High-Stakes-Poker-Game-Ends-in-Disaster-for-Chiefs" class="headerlink" title="High-Stakes Poker Game Ends in Disaster for Chiefs"></a>High-Stakes Poker Game Ends in Disaster for Chiefs</h1><p>In a game that would have decided who would represent the Chiefs in the Super Bowl, the poker game ended in disaster for the Chiefs.</p>
<p>Tom Brady and his New England Patriots were the beneficiaries of Kansas City’s epic meltdown, as they secured their spot in the championship game.</p>
<p>The Chiefs had a 4-1 lead with two players remaining on the table, but things quickly went downhill from there.</p>
<p>Both players ended up all-in, and after a long delay while the dealers sorted through the cards, it was revealed that one of the players had an Ace-King while the other had Ace-Ten.</p>
<p>The player with Ace-King was declared the winner, but the other player was not happy with how things played out.</p>
<p>“It was definitely fishy,” said the player who lost with Ace-Ten. “I’m not sure what happened, but I can’t believe I lost.”</p>
<p>While it’s impossible to know for sure what happened, most people believe that there was some sort of cheating going on.</p>
<p>The Chiefs have already issued a statement apologizing for what happened and stating that they will be investigating the matter further.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Supreme-Chiefs’-Poker-Game-Attracts-Huge-Crowd"><a href="#Casino-Supreme-Chiefs’-Poker-Game-Attracts-Huge-Crowd" class="headerlink" title="Casino Suprême Chiefs’ Poker Game Attracts Huge Crowd"></a>Casino Suprême Chiefs’ Poker Game Attracts Huge Crowd</h1><p>The Casino Suprême in Las Vegas was packed on Saturday night as poker fans gathered to watch the $10,000 buy-in No-Limit Texas Hold’em Tournament final table. The marquee event of the weekend, the tournament boasted a $1 million guaranteed prize pool and drew some of the biggest names in poker.</p>
<p>In the end, it was Ontario’s Sam Chartier who walked away with the title and the top prize of $371,858. Chartier had been one of the tournament’s big stacks for most of the final table, and he finally sealed victory when his ace-high held up against the kings of runner-up Amir Lehavot.</p>
<p>The final table also featured players such as Faraz Jaka, Josh Arieh and Matt Salsberg, all of whom were looking to take down one of poker’s most prestigious titles. However, in the end it was Chartier who emerged victorious to claim his first WSOP bracelet.</p>
<p>This year’s WSOP has seen several big names take down titles, including Phil Ivey (2), Erik Seidel (2), Mike Matusow (1) and Dan Smith (1). With only a few events remaining on this year’s schedule, there is still plenty of opportunity for other players to make their mark on the world’s richest poker series.</p>
<h1 id="Chiefs-Lose-Heated-Poker-Game-at-Casino-Supreme"><a href="#Chiefs-Lose-Heated-Poker-Game-at-Casino-Supreme" class="headerlink" title="Chiefs Lose Heated Poker Game at Casino Suprême"></a>Chiefs Lose Heated Poker Game at Casino Suprême</h1><p>This Thursday night, the Kansas City Chiefs hit the casino floor to take on the local competition in a heated poker game. Unfortunately for them, they came up short and lost big.</p>
<p>The Chiefs’ players were determined to win their money back after losing a few games on the field, but they just couldn’t seem to catch a break at the poker table. The other players at the table seemed to have more experience and know how to play the game well.</p>
<p>In the end, the Chiefs walked away from Casino Suprême empty handed and down several thousand dollars. It was not a winning night for them, but maybe they can take some of that money and use it to improve their performance on the football field.</p>
<h1 id="KC-Chiefs’-Poker-Game-Turns-Deadly"><a href="#KC-Chiefs’-Poker-Game-Turns-Deadly" class="headerlink" title="KC Chiefs’ Poker Game Turns Deadly"></a>KC Chiefs’ Poker Game Turns Deadly</h1><p>Early Monday morning, four men were found dead after a high stakes poker game in the home of Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Derrick Johnson. The victims, all in their early 20s, suffered gunshot wounds and were declared dead at the scene.</p>
<p>The game was attended by ten people, including Johnson and the four victims. According to police, an argument broke out during the game and led to the shootings. No arrests have yet been made, and the investigation is ongoing.</p>
<p>Johnson has been with the Chiefs since 2005 and is a veteran of the team. He released a statement following the shooting expressing his sorrow over what had happened and his intention to cooperate with investigators.</p>
<p>“The news of this tragedy is shocking and heartbreaking,” Johnson said in his statement. “My thoughts and prayers are with the families of those killed and wounded in this senseless act of violence.”</p>
<p>Chiefs head coach Andy Reid also issued a statement on behalf of the team, offering his condolences to the victims’ families and praising Johnson for his cooperation. “Our thoughts and prayers are with Derrick and everyone affected by this terrible tragedy,” Reid said.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that a deadly incident has occurred during a high stakes poker game. In 2011, three men were killed execution-style during a game in Tampa Bay. And in 2013, a man was shot dead during a game at an illegal gambling club in New York City.</p>
<p>The deaths have drawn renewed attention to the dangers of gambling, particularly when money is involved. While legal gambling venues such as casinos offer safeguards against violence, unregulated games can be dangerous places where disputes can turn deadly.</p>
