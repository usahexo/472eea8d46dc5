	  <h1 id="FLORIDA-LOOKING-TO-BAN-SPORTS-BETTING"><a href="#FLORIDA-LOOKING-TO-BAN-SPORTS-BETTING" class="headerlink" title="FLORIDA LOOKING TO BAN SPORTS BETTING"></a>FLORIDA LOOKING TO BAN SPORTS BETTING</h1><p>The state of Florida is looking to ban sports betting in the state, although it is currently unclear if the measure will be successful.</p>
<p>Republican State Senator Dana Young introduced the bill, which would prohibit both online and in-person sports betting. The measure would also make it illegal for bookmakers to take sports bets.</p>
<p>“As we work to finalize this legislation, I remain committed to fighting against the expansion of gambling in our state and protecting Floridians from its harms,” Young said.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Young has received campaign donations from Sheldon Adelson, a staunch opponent of gambling. Adelson is the owner of Las Vegas Sands Corporation, and he has long been opposed to online gambling.</p>
<p>The proposed bill comes as more states are looking to legalize sports betting in order to generate additional revenue. In fact, New Jersey recently won a court case that allowed them to proceed with their plans to legalize sports betting.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill argue that it will drive tourism dollars out of Florida and into other states that have legalized gambling. They also argue that it will create new jobs and bring in additional revenue for the state.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen if the proposed bill will be successful, but it is clear that there is growing opposition to gambling in Florida.</p>
<h1 id="FLORIDA-LEGISLATURE-MOVES-TO-MAKE-SPORTS-BETTING-ILLEGAL"><a href="#FLORIDA-LEGISLATURE-MOVES-TO-MAKE-SPORTS-BETTING-ILLEGAL" class="headerlink" title="FLORIDA LEGISLATURE MOVES TO MAKE SPORTS BETTING ILLEGAL"></a>FLORIDA LEGISLATURE MOVES TO MAKE SPORTS BETTING ILLEGAL</h1><p>The Florida legislature has moved to make sports betting illegal in the state, a move that is likely to be popular with the state’s residents.</p>
<p>Currently, there are no legal sports betting options in Florida, and it is unclear whether or not this will change in the future.</p>
<p>“We just don’t need that kind of negativity in our state,” said Senator Tom Lee, one of the legislators behind the bill.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill say that it is necessary to protect the people of Florida from the potential negative consequences of gambling addiction.</p>
<p>Critics of the bill argue that it will lead to a black market for sports betting and deprive the state of valuable tax revenue.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether or not this bill will pass into law, but it is clear that there is strong public support for making sports betting illegal in Florida.</p>
<h1 id="FLORIDA-SENATE-BILL-SEEKS-TO-OUTLAW-SPORTS-GAMBLING"><a href="#FLORIDA-SENATE-BILL-SEEKS-TO-OUTLAW-SPORTS-GAMBLING" class="headerlink" title="FLORIDA SENATE BILL SEEKS TO OUTLAW SPORTS GAMBLING"></a>FLORIDA SENATE BILL SEEKS TO OUTLAW SPORTS GAMBLING</h1><p>Florida lawmakers are seeking to outlaw sports gambling in the state, even as other states are moving to legalize it.</p>
<p>Senate Bill 812, introduced by State Senator Dennis Baxley, would make it a felony for anyone in Florida to place a bet on a sporting event. The bill is currently making its way through the legislative process.</p>
<p>Baxley said the bill is needed to protect people from the dangers of gambling addiction. “Gambling is not a victimless crime,” he said. “It destroys families and can lead to financial ruin.”</p>
<p>But some opponents of the bill say it’s a waste of time and money. They argue that sports betting is already happening illegally in Florida, and that taxing and regulating it would bring in much-needed revenue for the state.</p>
<p>A recent study by the National Conference of State Legislatures found that 32 states have introduced legislation related to sports betting this year, either to legalize it or to block it. So far, only six states have actually legalized sports betting.</p>
<h1 id="A-STEP-CLOSER-FOR-FLORIDA-TO-OUTLAW-SPORTS-BETTING"><a href="#A-STEP-CLOSER-FOR-FLORIDA-TO-OUTLAW-SPORTS-BETTING" class="headerlink" title="A STEP CLOSER FOR FLORIDA TO OUTLAW SPORTS BETTING?"></a>A STEP CLOSER FOR FLORIDA TO OUTLAW SPORTS BETTING?</h1><p>On Tuesday, May 14, 2019, the Florida Supreme Court issued a ruling in favor of the state’s prohibition of sports betting. The 5-2 ruling upheld a lower court’s decision that the 2017 law banning sports betting was not unconstitutional.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs in the case, including the Seminole Tribe of Florida, claimed that the ban violated a constitutional amendment approved by voters in 2010 that allowed pari-mutuel betting on horse and dog races. However, the Florida Supreme Court ruled that the amendment did not specifically mention sports betting and did not include it within its purview.</p>
<p>This is a big win for Florida lawmakers and for Governor Ron DeSantis, who signed the bill into law in 2017. This ban now prevents any type of sports betting from taking place within the state, including through offshore operators.</p>
<p>Florida is now one step closer to being among the states that have fully outlawed sports betting. So far, six states have passed laws banning all forms of sports gambling: Alabama, Idaho, Iowa, Mississippi, Nevada and Oregon.</p>
<h1 id="FLORIDA-SENATE-PASSES-BILL-TO-OUTLAW-SPORTS-BETTING"><a href="#FLORIDA-SENATE-PASSES-BILL-TO-OUTLAW-SPORTS-BETTING" class="headerlink" title="FLORIDA SENATE PASSES BILL TO OUTLAW SPORTS BETTING"></a>FLORIDA SENATE PASSES BILL TO OUTLAW SPORTS BETTING</h1><p>The Florida Senate passed a bill Wednesday that would outlaw sports betting in the state.</p>
<p>Sponsored by Sen. Joe Gruters, R-Sarasota, the legislation states that “a person may not knowingly engage in any type of gambling related to competitive sporting events.”</p>
<p> Violators would face a third-degree felony charge, punishable by up to five years in prison.</p>
<p>Gruters said he introduced the bill because he wanted to make sure Florida does not legalize sports betting, which is currently allowed in Nevada and New Jersey.</p>
<p>“I don’t want it here in Florida. I think it’s a bad idea. It harms people, it harms families, it harms businesses,” Gruters said on the Senate floor Wednesday.</p>
<p>Nine other senators co-sponsored Gruters’ bill, including Sens. Jeff Brandes, R-St. Petersburg; Aaron Bean, R-Fernandina Beach; Dana Young, R-Tampa; Jack Latvala, R-Clearwater; Gary Farmer Jr., D-Fort Lauderdale; Kevin Rader, D-Boca Raton; Audrey Gibson, D-Jacksonville; Randolph Bracy Jr., D-Orlando; and Linda Stewart, D-Orlando.</p>
