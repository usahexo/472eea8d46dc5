#  Inter Milan Pull Off Unlikely Victory Over Juventus

In the latest matchup of Italy’s two most successful clubs, Inter Milan pulled off an unlikely victory over Juventus. This was a significant win for Inter, who are in the midst of a contentious battle for Champions League qualification.

Juventus got out to an early lead in the first half, but Inter Milan battled back to take a 2-1 lead in the second half. Mauro Icardi scored the winning goal for Internazionale in the 73rd minute, denting Juventus’s hopes of winning another Serie A title.

This was a much-needed win for Inter Milan, who had lost their previous two matches against Juventus. With this victory, they moved into fourth place in the Serie A table, just one point behind Roma and three points behind third-place Napoli.

Inter Milan will next face Lazio, who are currently in fifth place in the Serie A table. If they can win that match, they will move into pole position for a spot in next season’s Champions League.

Mauro Icardi scored a last-minute winner as Inter Milan came from behind to beat Sampdoria 2-1 on Saturday and move up to third in Serie A.

Ivan Skorich had given Sampdoria the lead shortly before halftime, but Matteo Politano equalized for Inter with 10 minutes remaining.

And Icardi sealed all three points for Luciano Spalletti's side with a superb strike in the 90th minute.

Inter are now one point behind Roma and five behind second-placed Napoli, while Sampdoria are 14th.

#  Inter Milan Come From Behind To Earn A Point

Inter Milan battled from behind to earn a point in a 2-2 draw with Sassuolo on Sunday. Goals from Matteo Politano and Domenico Berardi had the hosts in front, but Ivan Perisic and Mauro Icardi salvaged a point for Inter.

Inter started the game brightly, but it was Sassuolo who took the lead in the 18th minute. Politano found the net after being played through by Berardi. The goal came against the run of play, and Inter continued to dominate possession despite going behind.

In the second half, Inter improved even further and equalized through Perisic in the 55th minute. The Croatian finished off a well-worked move by slotting past Andrea Consigli in the Sassuolo goal.

Inter then took the lead in the 74th minute through Icardi. The Argentine was played through by Matias Vecino and made no mistake with his finish, firing into the bottom corner.

However, Sassuolo were not done yet and they equalized in stoppage time through Berardi. The forward finished off a quick counterattack to earn his side a point.

#  Matteo Politano Scores The Only Goal In A 1-0 Win Over SPAL

Matteo Politano scored the only goal in Sassuolo's 1-0 win over SPAL on Saturday.

The Italian winger, who has been linked with a move away from the club in recent weeks, showed his quality by striking a superb winner midway through the second half.

Politano took advantage of some poor defending to curl a right-footed shot beyond Alex Meret and into the far corner of the net.

Sassuolo had chances to add to their lead but were denied by some impressive saves from Meret, while SPAL went close themselves but failed to find an equaliser.

The result sees Sassuolo climb up to eighth in the Serie A table, while SPAL remain in 17th place.

#  Inter Milan Lose Ground In Race For Champions League Spot

Sunday's 3-1 Serie A defeat at the hands of resurgent Atalanta saw Inter Milan lose further ground in their pursuit of a Champions League spot.

The Nerazzurri are now six points behind fourth-placed Lazio, with just seven games remaining.

Manager Luciano Spalletti made three changes to the side that lost to Juventus in their previous league outing, with Matias Vecino, Antonio Candreva and Stefan De Vrij coming into the starting line-up.

However, it was an afternoon to forget for the former Roma boss as his side were comprehensively beaten by Gian Piero Gasperini's men.

Lazio's victory over Chievo on Saturday meant that Inter Milan could not cut the gap at the top of the table, and they now find themselves in a battle to qualify for Europe's premier club competition.

In truth, Inter Milan were second-best throughout Sunday's game and they never looked like getting back into the contest after Andrea Masiello had given Atalanta a first-half lead.

The visitors added two more goals in the second period through Duvan Zapata and Josip Ilicic, with Mauro Icardi netting a consolation goal late on.

Inter Milan have now won just one of their last six league fixtures and they will need to get back to winning ways if they are to have any chance of qualifying for the Champions League.
