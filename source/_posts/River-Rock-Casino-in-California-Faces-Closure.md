#  River Rock Casino in California Faces Closure

The privately owned River Rock Casino in California is at risk of closure after its owner, the Rincon Band of Luiseño Indians, failed to reach an agreement with the state over taxes.

The casino, which is located in the city of Harrison in Riverside County, has been in operation since 2004 and employs around 1,000 people. The Rincon Band of Luiseño Indians say that they have already paid $140 million in taxes to the state since the casino opened, but the state is now demanding an additional $350 million.

The tribe has filed a lawsuit against the state, arguing that their existing payments are more than enough. They also claim that the new tax would effectively put them out of business.

"This would be an economic death blow to our tribe and our people," said tribal chairman Steve Ban confirm. "It would devastate our local economy."

If the casino closes, it will be a major blow to the local economy, as it is one of the largest employers in the area. It is also estimated that it contributes around $25 million annually to local businesses.

#  Officials order River Rock Casino in California to close

After a long investigation, authorities ordered the closure of the River Rock Casino in California. The casino has been accused of money laundering and other financial crimes.

The casino had been under suspicion for months, after large sums of money were deposited into the casino's accounts from several different sources. Investigators believe that the money was transferred to the casino in order to disguise its origins.

Authorities were able to piece together the money trail and determine that the casino was complicit in laundering money for criminal organizations. As a result, officials ordered the casino to close its doors immediately.

This is a major win for law enforcement officials, who have been working hard to crack down on financial crimes in California. The closure of the River Rock Casino will send a clear message that casinos will not be tolerated as a hub for criminal activity.

#  Judge rejects appeal to keep River Rock Casino open in California

The River Rock Casino in California will soon be shutting down, after a judge rejected an appeal to keep it open. The casino, which is owned by the Morongo Band of Mission Indians, has been in operation for over 10 years.

However, the Morongo Band has been struggling to keep the casino open in recent years. In 2017, the casino was ordered to close due to its failure to renew its gaming license. However, the casino was able to stay open after the Morongo Band filed an appeal.

Now, that appeal has been rejected, and the casino will be closing its doors on March 15th. This will leave nearly 1,000 employees without a job.

The Morongo Band issued a statement following the news of the appeal’s rejection. “We are obviously disappointed with today’s ruling but remain committed to finding a resolution that keeps as many people employed as possible and protects our tribal sovereign rights,” said tribe chairman Robert Martin.

It is unclear what the future holds for the River Rock Casino employees. However, the Morongo Band has said that it is committed to finding a resolution that keeps as many people employed as possible.

#  River Rock Casino, in California, to close after all

The River Rock Casino, in California, will be closing its doors after all. This news comes despite earlier reports that the casino would remain open.

The reason for the closure is a lack of revenue. The casino has been losing money for some time now, and the owners have decided that it is no longer financially viable to keep it open.

This is bad news for the employees of the casino, as well as for the local community. The casino was a major employer in the area, and its closure will leave many people out of work.

Additionally, the closure of the casino will have a negative impact on the local economy. The casino was a major source of revenue for restaurants, hotels, and other businesses in the area. With its closure, these businesses will likely see a significant decrease in sales.

#  Fate of River Rock Casino in California still uncertain

After negotiations between the tribe that owns River Rock Casino in California and the state government broke down in early 2018, the fate of the casino is still uncertain.

The tribe, which is known as the Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria, wants to build a new casino on their reservation land, but the state government is opposed to this. They argue that the tribe already has a successful casino, and that the new one would be harmful to other businesses in the area.

A recent report from The Press Democrat suggests that there may be some hope for a resolution to the conflict. Bipartisan legislation has been introduced in both the Senate and Assembly that would allow the new casino to be built while also setting aside money for local communities affected by it.

If this legislation is approved, it would represent a major victory for the tribe and would provide much-needed revenue for them. The Graton Rancheria has been trying to build a new casino for many years, and this legislation would finally allow them to do so.
