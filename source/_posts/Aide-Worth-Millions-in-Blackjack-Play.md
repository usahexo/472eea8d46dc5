#  Aide Worth Millions in Blackjack Play

A recent study has found that a computer-generated strategy can be used to win millions of dollars from blackjack tables. The system, which takes just minutes to learn, is based on a mathematical algorithm that has been tweaks over many years by an anonymous computer programmer.

The so-called “basic strategy” for blackjack has been known for decades and is widely used by players. However, the new system takes things one step further, by incorporating complicated computer code that predicts how the dealer will play their hand. The code also accounts for cards that have already been played – so even if the player doesn’t know what’s in the deck, they can still make a profit.

To use the system, players simply need to enter their age and weight into the programme, and it will generate a personalised strategy for them. The programme is currently available online for $99 per year.

Despite its impressive results in tests, some experts are sceptical of how well it would work in the real world. Blackjack is a complex game with many different rule variations, and casinos are likely to change the rules if they feel someone is exploiting them.

Nevertheless, the basic strategy has already made millions for its users in live casino play. It is only a matter of time before someone wins big using this new algorithm – so why not be that person?

#  Austrian Casino Staff Member Wins Huge Prize

An Austrian casino worker has hit the jackpot, winning a huge prize worth €825,000. The lucky winner is a 67-year-old man who has worked as a croupier at the casino for over 30 years. He was playing one of the slot machines when he hit the big win.

The delighted pensioner said that he couldn’t believe his luck and that it was an amazing feeling to have won such a large sum of money. He added that he planned to use the money to pay off his debts and to take a much-needed holiday.

This is not the first time that an Austrian casino worker has landed a big jackpot. In July 2017, another croupier at the same casino won €2 million on a slot machine.

#  How Much is an Aide Worth in Blackjack? $5M apparently!

Las Vegas, Nevada (September 9, 2019) - A recent blackjack outing at the Bellagio casino in Las Vegas has resulted in a record setting payout of over $5 million. The lucky player, who has chosen to remain anonymous, was aided by a personal assistant who helped count cards and make informed bets.

The previous record for blackjack payouts was set in 2016 at the Rivers Casino in Pittsburgh where a player won just over $4.8 million. Blackjack is a popular casino game due to its relatively low house edge of around 1%. With the help of an aide, however, this house edge can be reduced to almost zero, making it possible for players with limited bankrolls to gamble with large sums of money.

Aides can be hired for a variety of services including card counting, betting advice, and money management. Prices for these services vary depending on the quality and experience of the aide, but typically start at around $1,000 per day.

Despite the large potential payout, many players are reluctant to use an aide out of fear that they will be caught and banned from casinos. Aide usage is highly scrutinized by casino security personnel and can often lead to being banned from playing at that particular casino.

For those willing to take the risk, however, an aide can be a life-changing experience and provide the chance to win big money without having to risk any of your own.
